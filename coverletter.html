            <p class="paragraph1">I have a solid experience in Front-end development by using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js. I have recently completed my studies in Iran (July 2021) and got a B.Sc. degree in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am in a Front-end mentorship with Danial Salahi and I have more than 4 months of internship experience in a bank. Also during my studies, I did a variety of small and large projects by using Flutter, Dart, C/C++, and SQL (DBMS).</p>
            <p>      I am a very multi task and fast learner person and also can desire to constantly develop my skills. During my final dissertation, I created and developed an android application of a task planner. My dissertation was nominated for a university award. </p>
